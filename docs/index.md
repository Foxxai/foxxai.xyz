# Introduction

I am a life-long researcher, now functioning as a (mature) post-doctoral Indigenous Research Fellow somewhere amidst the social and computer sciences-- some call this space "computational social science." I'm not fond of this moniker, for the simple reason that social science rarely achieves or aspires to high degrees of computational reduction, regularity and predictability. At any rate, this is a subject to which I may return. My primary focus is human-machine cognitive partnering and human activity-orchestration competencies for sociocultural advancement and knowledge innovation. 

This site offers both formal and informal sets of technical, conceptual, perceptual, cultural and sometimes critical entries arising from various human-machine research activities, which are scheduled for two years. I have no fixed expectation about what one may find here, but it is my goal to add entries on a somewhat regular basis as a means of giving expression to a journey.

I'll likely say more about my background, perspectives, interests, etc. as time passes.
