# Introduction

I am a life-long researcher, now functioning as an Indigenous Research Fellow somewhere amidst the social and computer sciences-- some call this space "computational social science." I'm not fond of this moniker, for the simple reason that social science rarely achieves or aspires to computational reduction, regularity and predictability. At any rate, this is a subject to which I may return. This site offers a completely informal set of technical, conceptual, perceptual, cultural and sometimes critical entries arising from human-machine research activities. I really have no concrete idea what one may find here, but it is a goal to add entries on a somewhat regular basis without being tied to a schedule.
