# A Quick OmniGen Installation Guide (Ubuntu 24.04.1 with an nVidia GPU)

## Task Overview

Tonight, we completed a fresh installation of Ubuntu 24.01.1 LTS and a bare metal installation of OmniGen. It took a few tries to configure CUDA, cuDDN and a few (undocumented) dependencies correctly. At the end of the night, we had a launcher configured in Gnome and OmniGen up and running ready for testing. This is a brief how-to guide culled from the procedures that worked. I miss my shiny Fedora desktop, but it's nice to have a well-worn OS that works rather than amuses. Lord knows, I'm a sucker for [r/LinuxPorn] (<https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxPorn/rdt=32971>). 

## **Overview**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and run **OmniGen** on Ubuntu 24.04.1, ensuring NVIDIA GPU support with CUDA and PyTorch. It includes pre-installation preparation and core installation steps.

---

## **Pre-Installation Preparation**

### **1. Verify NVIDIA Drivers**

Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed and working:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If not installed, refer to the [NVIDIA driver installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html).

---

### **2. Install CUDA Toolkit**

1. Confirm your installed CUDA version:

   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

   If CUDA is not installed, download and install it:
   - Visit [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
   - Select the correct version for Ubuntu 24.04.

2. Add CUDA to your environment:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

---

### **3. Install cuDNN**

1. Download the compatible cuDNN version for your CUDA:
   - Visit [cuDNN Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
   - Select the version matching your CUDA release.

2. Install the `.deb` packages:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i libcudnn*.deb
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   dpkg -l | grep libcudnn
   ```

---

### **4. Install Python 3.10**

Ubuntu 24.04 defaults to Python 3.12, so install Python 3.10:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-distutils
```

---

## **Core Installation Steps**

### **1. Clone the OmniGen Repository**

1. Navigate to your desired directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/foxxai/AI/omnigen
   cd /home/foxxai/AI/omnigen
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen.git .
   ```

---

### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**

1. Create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv omnigen_env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source omnigen_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Upgrade pip:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

---

### **3. Install PyTorch**

Install the PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA version (e.g., 12.4 uses CUDA 12.0 builds):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu120
```

---

### **4. Install OmniGen**

1. Install OmniGen in editable mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (if `gradio` or other modules are missing):

   ```bash
   pip install gradio spaces
   ```

---

### **5. Launch OmniGen**

1. Run the OmniGen application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the provided URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in your browser to access the OmniGen interface.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Missing Dependencies**: Install missing Python packages as needed.
- **Model Downloads**: Large pre-trained models (~15GB each) will download on the first run. Ensure sufficient disk space.
- **CUDA Issues**: Verify CUDA setup with:

  ```bash
  python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
  ```
