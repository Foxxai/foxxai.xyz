# Content Staging Area

This directory is used for staging and editing all draft content before publication. 

- `essays/`: Full draft essays (Markdown with YAML header)
- `abstracts/`: Abstracts (Markdown with YAML header)
- `logs/`: Registry and workflow logs
- `WORKFLOW.md`: Protocol and workflow documentation

Move finalized content to the appropriate published section (e.g., `/docs/blog/`) for automation and indexing.
