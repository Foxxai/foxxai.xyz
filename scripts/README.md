# Automation Scripts

This directory contains all Python scripts for site automation, publishing, indexing, and integrations.

- `blog/`: Blog publishing and indexing scripts
- `travelogue/`: Photo processing and travelogue automation
- `integrations/`: Future integrations (e.g., Zotero, LLM)

Each subdirectory should include its own README.md for context-specific documentation.
